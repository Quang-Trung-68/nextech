## v1.4.0 — 2026-06-21

### Added
- **Admin management tab**: New "Quản trị viên" tab in admin user page with `GET /api/admin/admins` endpoint.
- **Admin email exclusion**: `getUsers` now excludes any user whose email matches an admin account.

### Fixed
- **Admin user table 500 error**: Removed non-existent `role` field from `USER_SELECT` and user query; avatar fallback changed from broken `via.placeholder.com` to initials-based inline circle.
- **AI chat 500 error**: Wrapped `response.text()` in try-catch with alternative extraction; `sendChatMessage` Gemini call now returns friendly fallback on failure.
- **Rate limiting**: Global `apiLimiter` 100→300 req/15min; AI `aiLimiter` 5→10 req/min; added `pusherAuthLimiter` 60 req/min.
- **SePay redirect**: Fixed redirect URL construction for VietQR callback.
- **Admin notification badge**: Added `staleTime: Infinity` + `initialData` from localStorage to unread count query; `prependNotification` uses `setQueryData` increment instead of `invalidateQueries`; API calls wrapped in try/catch.
- **User notification blank state (protectUserOrAdmin)**: `protectUserOrAdmin` middleware now prefers `access_token` (user) over `admin_access_token` (admin) — fixes empty notification list when user also logged into admin panel.
- **Pusher auth 403 (cookie priority)**: Pusher auth route moved before `protectUserOrAdmin` middleware; `authenticatePusher` rewritten to manually verify JWT tokens (tries `access_token` first, falls back to `admin_access_token`) instead of relying on `req.user` from middleware.

### Changed
- **Admin login page**: Removed "Quên mật khẩu?" and "Đăng ký" links (admin login only).
- **Admin user page**: Split into "Người dùng" and "Quản trị viên" tabs with independent search/pagination.

## v1.3.0 — 2026-05-24

### Added
- **Interactive Scalar API Reference**: Integration of self-hosted `@scalar/express-api-reference` at `/api-docs` using the full OpenAPI 3.0 specification with 3-column UI, interactive testing, and dark mode.
- **Homepage Live Flash Sale**: Interactive homepage showcase with high-performance real-time countdown, animated fire elements, and custom stock sold indicators with dynamic gradient progress bars.
- **Wishlist & Price Drop Alerts**: Trigger-based wishlist notification engine. Automatically detects price drops, updates database notifications, broadcasts real-time WebSockets via Soketi, and sends HTML transactional emails using Nodemailer and custom EJS templates.
- **Admin Dashboard leaderboards**: REST layout featuring top 5 best-selling products list side-by-side with Recharts revenue graphs, equipped with ranking medals, sales progress bars, and product thumbnails.
- **Customer Addresses Viewer**: Pop-up directory displaying full customer address books dynamically retrieved through database queries in the admin user panel.
- **Admin Order Notes**: Internal secure annotations (`adminNote` field in Prisma schema and database) with a `PATCH` route `/api/admin/orders/:id/note` and details modal text editor.
- **Python data crawlers**: `crawl_cellphones.py` and `crawl_sforum.py` scripts for automated product and blog content harvesting from cellphones.com.vn and Sforum.

## v1.2.0 — 2026-04-07

### Added
- Production deployment on VPS with shared Nginx proxy and `shared-proxy-network` for multi-app routing
- Automated Let's Encrypt SSL via Certbot container with renewal loop
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline: ESLint → Docker Buildx → push to GHCR → SSH deploy → `prisma migrate deploy`
- Multi-language support (Vietnamese / English) via i18next and browser language detection

### Changed
- Nginx config extended to support co-hosted NexChat on the same VPS
- `docker-entrypoint.sh` now runs `prisma migrate deploy` on every container start as a safety net
